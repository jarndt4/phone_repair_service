            <p><b>We had started right around the first Iphone had been released which was in 2007 here in Des Moines. Back then we didn't 
            have a website or anything of that matter because we were first locally set in place here in Indianola. Now
            that we are competing with other local stores, our profits had led us to work continuously throughout these years.</b></p>

            <b>I first started getting into phone repairs when my Nokia broke back in 05 which had me frustrated. Ended up going to 
            the store with my mom to pay out of pocket which was a hefty fee. My younger entrepreneurial mind was fed up with having 
            to go and pay every time my phone broke so I decided to just do it myself. The parts were easy to find online and the 
            instructions to do so were so very simple.</b>

            <b>First it started off with just some of my family members and close friends. After awhile once I started getting the hang of 
            it and branched out to students in school and then started a little business out of my dorm room. Once I saw that there was something 
            to do with this to make money, I branched out to some friends and crowd-sourced the money to open up my little shop.</b>

            without the help and resources that Simpson College had provided for us. This is only the beginning
            and I know that we will succeed and hopefully make it into the international market. To keep updated with us
